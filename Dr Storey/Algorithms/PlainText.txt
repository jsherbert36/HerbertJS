CHARLIE AND TRINITY,I THINK WE HAVE COME AS CLOSE AS WE CAN TO A SOLUTION TO THIS VERY ODD CASE OF A DEAD WOMAN WHO NEVER DIED, A WEAPON THAT NEVER EXISTED AND A GOVERNMENT INITIATIVE THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE GOVERNMENT.MARTIN AND JAMELIA WERE PUT IN A TERRIBLE POSITION, I HADN’T REALISED JUST HOW BAD UNTIL I READ THE ATTACHED DOCUMENT THAT I RECOVERED FROM MARTIN’S AND JAMELIA ’S HARD DRIVE. IT TELLS THE WHOLE STORY.THE SYNDICATE PROBABLY THOUGHT THEY WERE BEING CLEVER WHEN THEY FAKED JAMELIA’S DEATH. THERE WAS A CLEAR THREAT THAT ONCE HER “DEATH” WAS RECORDED AS SUICIDE THEY COULD DISPOSE OF HER IN THEIR OWN WAY AND IN THEIR OWN TIME IF SHE FAILED TO COOPERATE. WHAT THEY FAILED TO REALISE IS THAT ONCE SHE WAS OFFICIALLY DEAD NO ONE WOULD BE LOOKING OUT FOR HER AND IT MADE IT A LOT EASIER FOR HER TO DISAPPEAR WHEN SHE WANTED TO. HAVING BEEN CUT LOOSE FROM THE GOVERNMENT THE SYNDICATE WERE RELYING ON SOURCES IN THE INTERNATIONAL INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY TO CARRY OUT SURVEILLANCE FOR THEM BUT NO-ONE WOULD BE WATCHING FOR A GHOST AND TOO MANY QUESTIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN ASKED IF THEY REQUESTED A SEARCH ONCE SHE WAS OFFICIALLY DEAD.I THINK THAT DYNAMIX REALISED EARLY ON WHAT THE TEMPLATE APPROACH COULD DO FOR LARGE SCALE NETWORK ANALYSIS, AND THEY REALISED THAT JAMELIA HAD THE TALENT (AND MARTIN THE AMBITION) TO MAKE IT WORK. AS A SMALL COMPANY THEY HAD NOTHING TO LOSE BY INVESTING IN IT, BUT WHEN CITADELLE HEARD RUMOURS THAT THEY WERE WORKING ON SOMETHING BIG THEY REALISED THAT THIS COULD BE THE BREAKTHROUGH THEY NEEDED. THEIR MASSIVE INVESTMENT IN CONVENTIONAL BATTLEFIELD WEAPONRY THREATENED TO BECOME OBSOLETE ON THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD AND THEY WERE SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING NEW TO REVITALISE THE COMPANY. AT FIRST I THINK THEY GENUINELY MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT DYNAMIX WERE WORKING ON. THE CONFUSION BETWEEN GRAVITY WAVES AND GRAVITATIONAL WAVES LED EVERYONE TO ASSUME THAT DYNAMIX WERE HOPING TO WEAPONIZE SEISMIC ACTIVITY, PERHAPS VIA A RESONANCE EFFECT, BUT THIS WAS NEVER ABOUT A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION AS JAMELIA’S EXPOSE MAKES CLEAR.I AM NOT SURE AT WHAT POINT THE POST DIGITAL SURVEILLANCE SYNDICATE GOT INVOLVED. THEY WERE INITIALLY SET UP TO PREPARE FOR A TIME WHEN DIGITAL SURVEILLANCE IS NO LONGER EFFECTIVE: A QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE CONTENT OF COMMUNICATIONS IS ENCRYPTED SO SECURELY THAT NO ALGORITHM CAN CRACK IT WITHOUT BETRAYING ITS PRESENCE. THEY WERE KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON ALL THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAMS AT ARMS MANUFACTURERS AND HAD KEPT JAMELIA AND MARTIN UNDER OBSERVATION WHEN WORKING FOR DYNAMIX. THEY WERE CERTAINLY QUICK TO REALISE THE POTENTIAL OF THE SIGNAL NOISE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES THE PAIR HAD DEVELOPED FOR GRAVITATIONAL WAVE DETECTION. AT SOME POINT THOUGH SOMEONE REALISED THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAW IN USING A TEMPLATE BASED APPROACH, WHICH IN A BETTER WORLD WOULD HAVE LED TO THE END OF THE PROJECT. UNFORTUNATELY SOME EVIL GENIUS AT THE SYNDICATE SAW A SOLUTION, AND, GIVEN THE OBVIOUS LIMITS ON GOVERNMENT ACTION IN THIS SPHERE, THEY DECIDED TO LEVERAGE PRIVATE SECTOR INVOLVEMENT. GIVEN THEIR HUNGER FOR RELEVANCE CITADELLE WERE AN OBVIOUS TARGET AND WERE BROUGHT INTO THE PICTURE. UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE SYNDICATE, SOMEONE AT CITADELLE BLABBED TO A SENIOR CIVIL SERVANT AND THE WHOLE OPERATION WAS TERMINATED. THE JUNIOR OPERATIVES WERE DISPERSED AMONG OTHER DEPARTMENTS BUT THE MAJOR PLAYERS WERE RETIRED. WE NOW KNOW THAT THE REMAINS OF THE SYNDICATE CONTINUED TO OPERATE WITH CITADELLE AND DYNAMIX FUNDING, A GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT NO LONGER.I WAS THROWN BY MARTIN’S CALL TO THE PHONE LINKED TO CITADELLE DURING THE INTERVIEW LAST WEEK AND FOR A MOMENT THOUGHT THAT HE WAS WORKING WITH THEM, BUT OF COURSE HE WAS NOT PHONING CITADELLE, IF WE TRACK THE PHONE WE WILL FIND JAMELIA. WITH NO REAL RESOURCES OF THEIR OWN SHE AND MARTIN SEEMS TO HAVE PLAYED THE BLACK HATS AT THEIR OWN GAME, TAKING WHAT THEY NEED AS THEY PREPARED TO DOUBLE CROSS THEM.YOU MIGHT ASK WHY SHE IS NOT MAKING MORE OF AN EFFORT TO HIDE FROM THE SYNDICATE AND ITS ALLIES, BUT THAT IS THE BEAUTY OF THE WAY THEY HAVE THIS SET UP. MARTIN’S TIME WITH THE COLLECTIVE HAS BEEN SPENT SEEDING COPIES OF THE FILE ONTO EVERY SERVER HE COULD FIND. IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO THEM NOW IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SYNDICATE, DYNAMIX OR CITADELLE TO SUPPRESS THE INFORMATION. IT WOULD FLOOD THE WEB. THEIR APPARENT CARELESSNESS (WEAK ENCRYPTION AND POORLY HIDDEN DOCUMENTS, MARTIN’S APPEARANCE ON BANK SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS AND HIS VISIBILITY ON THE WEB) WERE ALL PART OF A SCHEME TO ENSURE THE AUTHORITIES GOT SUSPICIOUS. A SORT OF INSURANCE POLICY. IT FORCED THE SYNDICATE TO PROTECT THEM, HENCE THE HIGH QUALITY TRAVEL DOCUMENTS.TO GET REAL PROTECTION JAMELIA HAD TO MAKE SURE THEIR STORY COULDN’T BE SQUASHED SO THEY HAD TO BUY TIME. SHE AND MARTIN AGREED TO WORK WITH THE SYNDICATE AND TO CONSPIRE IN JAMELIA’S FAKED DEATH, AND I THINK THEY CONVINCED THE SYNDICATE TO LET MARTIN JOIN THE HACKER COLLECTIVE BY PRESENTING IT AS A GOOD COVER FOR DATA COLLECTION, ARGUING THAT THEY NEEDED TO SET THE BASELINE FOR THE BEHAVIOURAL TEMPLATES.BUT NOW THE BIG QUESTION. DO WE GO PUBLIC? IF WE DO IT WILL LANCE THE BOIL AND WE HAVE A REAL CHANCE OF BRINGING DOWN THE SYNDICATE AND ITS COLLABORATORS IN SEVERAL MAJOR ARMS MANUFACTURERS. WE MIGHT ALSO BE ABLE TO TRACE THE TEMPLATE TARGETS. ON THE OTHER HAND IF WE DO THAT WE ALSO RISK KILLING JAMELIA AND MARTIN. ONCE THE STORY IS PUBLIC THERE IS NO REASON FOR THE PDS SYNDICATE TO KEEP THEM ALIVE, AND EVERY REASON TO SILENCE WITNESSES. I DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU THINK, BUT I THINK WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THIS OFFLINE. THE OLD FASHIONED WAY.I ASSUME THAT YOU HAVE LEFT NIJMEGEN WITH THE REAL FINAL CHAPTER OF TACITUS’S LAST WORK, TO RETURN TO NORMALITY IN LONDON. AS WE AGREED IT WOULD BE BEST TO KEEP ITS DISCOVERY SECRET UNTIL THE COLLECTOR HAS BEEN GIVEN THE FAKE BY MIDAS. I WANT TO THANK YOU WITH ALL MY HEART FOR YOUR HELP WITH BREAKING THE MIDAS SYNDICATE. THE PLAN TO REPLACE THE FINAL CHAPTER OF TACITUS’S BOOK WITH A FORGERY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT YOUR SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE. I KNOW THAT HARRY WAS A LITTLE ALARMED AT THE SPEED WITH WHICH YOU WERE ABLE TO PRODUCE IT, AND I SHOULD SAY THAT HE IS KEEPING A CAREFUL EYE ON YOU FOR NOW IN CASE YOUR OTHERWISE SPOTLESS RECORD CONCEALS A SECOND SECRET CAREER! FOR MYSELF I THINK THAT IF YOU WOULD BE INTERESTED THEN MY AGENCY COULD USE YOUR SKILLS.ONCE WE ARE SURE THAT THE COLLECTOR HAS TAKEN CUSTODY OF THE FAKE YOU CAN ANNOUNCE THE REAL DOCUMENT AT THE BRITISH LIBRARY AND WE WILL RELEASE A TRANSLATION OF IT HIGHLIGHTING OUR SECRET MESSAGE ON THE DARK WEB. WHEN THE COLLECTOR SEES THAT I SUSPECT THAT THE REVENGE ON MIDAS WILL BE SWIFT AND MERCILESS. WE WILL BE WATCHING, AND WITH LUCK WE WILL ALSO DISCOVER THE IDENTITY OF THE COLLECTOR. I THINK THERE MAY BE GREAT PROFIT IN MONITORING HIS OR HER CONNECTIONS. IN ORDER TO GIVE THE DOCUMENT SOME EXTRA VALIDITY WE HAVE ENCRYPTED IT USING THE HARDEST OF THE IMPERIAL CIPHERS. THAT WAY ONLY THE COLLECTOR IS LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO READ IT.MEANWHILE IT IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE THAT WE KEEP YOU SAFE. THE COLLECTOR DOES NOT KNOW OF YOUR INVOLVEMENT IN OUR PLAN AND THERE IS NO REASON WHY THAT SHOULD CHANGE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU RETURN TO YOUR WORK AT THE BRITISH LIBRARY FOR NOW,THEY WILL BE DELIGHTED TO RECEIVE THE ORIGINAL COPY OF TACITUS’S FINAL WORK. AS I SAID BEFORE, HARRY’S TEAM WILL BE WATCHING YOU AND THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO ENSURE YOUR SAFETY.IT HAS BEEN A GREAT PLEASURE AND PRIVILEGE TO WORK WITHYOU.I HOPE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER AGAIN.MARYAMIN HIS JOURNAL DATED THE IDES OF OCTOBER IN THE YEAR OF THE CONSULSHIPS OF CAECELIUS TULLIUS CAPITO POMPONIANUS PLOTIUS FIRMUS AND GAIUS CORNELIUS GALLICANUS, AGRICOLA WROTE“THE MYSTERY OF THE BATTLE AT CAMULODONUM IS AT LAST SOLVED. CALGACUS MAY BE A BARBARIAN NOW, BUT HE WAS A ROMAN CITIZEN THEN, WHO BETRAYED US ALL FOR LOVE OF A BARBARIAN. IT HAS TAKEN ALL MY SKILLS AS A LEADER OF MEN TO KEEP HIM ALIVE.THE LEGIONNAIRES SPEND THEIR EVENINGS DESIGNING NEW AND CRUEL WAYS TO EXECUTE HIM IN REVENGE FOR THE SHAME HE BROUGHT UPON US, BUT HIS LIFE IS PRECIOUS. IT IS THE ONLY CARD LEFT TO PLAY IN OUR SEARCH FOR SALVATION AND THE RETURN OF THESTOLEN AQUILAE. IF WE CAN ALSO RECOVER THE CODEX THEN PERHAPS ITS LOSS CAN BE CONCEALED AND OUR LIVES WILL BE SPARED.RELEASING THE ROMAN TRAITOR CALGACUS MUST HAVE STUCK IN THE PROUD AGRICOLA’S THROAT, BUT HE MADE A PACT WITH THEREMAINING CALEDONII AND TRAVELLED NORTH TO EXCHANGE THE PRISONER FOR THE AQUILAE AND THE CODEX. BUT THE CUNNING CALEDONIAN TRIBESMAN SET ANOTHER TRAP AND PRESENTED AGRICOLA WITH A FORGERY CUNNINGLY ASSEMBLED WITH PAGES FROM THE BOOKSSTOLEN WHEN THE TRIBE RANSACKED MONS GRAUPIUS. FOR TOO LONG THE SONS OF ROME HAD UNDERESTIMATED THE PEOPLE IN BRITANNIA AND WHILE THE AQUILA OF THE LEGION HAD BEEN RESTORED BY THE EXCHANGE, THEIR HONOUR WAS NOT. AGRICOLA FACED A RETURNTO ROME, HUMILIATION AND ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH.THE SIXTH CHAPTER OF MY TALE OF WOE IS GUARDED BY LIGHTNING, BULL AND OAK.MARYAM, JODIE HAS GONE.I ARRIVED IN SELCUK AS PLANNED, BUT SHE DIDN'T MAKE THE RENDEZVOUS. THE LOCAL STATION THINK SHE MAY HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO RANSOM DEMAND AND THERE IS NOTHING MUCH TO GO ON. HER ROOM HAD BEEN RANSACKED AND SHE LEFT NO MESSAGE, BUT SOMETHING TELLS ME SHE IS OK AND WE SHOULD MOVE ON. I THINK SHE MAY HAVE PLANNED THIS.MEANWHILE I HAVE THE DOCUMENT JODIE WANTED FROM LONDON. I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE KNEW, BUT THE FIFTH CHAPTER WAS HIDDEN IN A CAVITY IN A STONE LINTEL IN SOME REMAINS IN THE EPHESUS ROOM AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM. IT WAS ENCRYPTED USING ANOTHER POLYALPHABETIC CIPHER INVENTED IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. I ASKED THE MUSEUM TO TEST IT AND THE DOCUMENT IS AUTHENTIC SO I GUESS THEIMPERIAL CIPHER SCHOOL REALLY HAD MOVED ON. PERHAPS I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED AFTER THE DISCOVERY AT BODRUM, BUT IT LEAVES ME WONDERING WHAT ELSE THEY DEVELOPED. ONE ODD FEATURE WAS A FRIEZE RUNNING ROUND THREE SIDES OF THE LINTEL CONSISTING OF A SINGLE ROW OF BLACK AND WHITE TILES THAT THE MUSEUM THINK WERE ADDED IN THE ROMAN PERIOD. THEY READ IN SEQUENCE I HAVE USED B FOR THE BLACK TILES AND W FOR THE WHITE ONES. IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO FIGURE OUT THAT THE FRIEZE IS STEGANOGRAPHY, CONCEALING THE KEYWORD FOR THE CIPHER IN CHAPTER FIVE.WITHOUT JODIE I AM NOT SURE WHERE TO GO NEXT. THERE ARE ONLY TWO POSSIBILITIES AS FAR AS I CAN SEE, BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE ONE OF THEM IS, AND AS FAR AS I CAN TELL NO-ONE ELSE KNOWS EITHER, SO I GUESS I WILL HEAD FOR OLYMPIA. SEE YOU THERE?NOTES FROM INTERVIEW WITH MARTIN TRAYNORIN ATTENDANCE: MI, NSA AND REPS FROM NISTHE SUSPECT WAS CARRYING HIGH QUALITY IDENTITY DOCUMENTS IN THE NAME OF JAMES MARTIN AND CLAIMED TO BE A DROP OUT FROM A GRADUATE PROGRAMME IN COMPUTER SCIENCE IN NEUCHATEL. HIS STORY CHECKED OUT WITH THE UNIVERSITY AUTHORITIES.ANALYSIS SHOWED A HIGH DEGREE OF CORRELATION BETWEEN THE BIOMETRICS OF THE SUSPECT AND OF MARTIN TRAYNOR, BUT WE DID NOT REVEAL THAT WE SUSPECTED JAMES TO BE MARTIN. HE REFUSED REQUESTS TO PROVIDE A DNA SAMPLE FOR ANALYSIS, STATING THAT DNA DATABASES WERE A TOOL OF OPPRESSION.A SEARCH OF THE SUSPECT’S BELONGINGS FOUND NO LINKS WITH THE UK AT ALL DESPITE THE FACT THAT VOICE CHARACTERISTICS SUGGEST HE SPENT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME THERE AS A CHILD. THE SUSPECT STATED THAT HE HAD LEFT ALL THAT BEHIND ANDWAS NOT PREPARED TO TALK ABOUT IT.TAKING CARE NOT TO REVEAL WHAT WAS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT TRAYNOR’S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SWISS BANK, WE TURNED TO THE SUSPECT’S FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS. AT FIRST HE CLAIMED TO WORK ENTIRELY ON A CASH BASIS AND NOT TO HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT, BUT WHEN PRESSED ON THIS HE COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT EXPLAIN WHERE HE KEPT HIS CASH RESERVE EVEN WHEN WE POINTED OUT THAT HE APPEARED TO BE TOO WELL OFF FOR SOMEONE LIVING HAND TO MOUTHPUSHING HARDER WE REVEALED THAT WE HAD FOOTAGE OF HIM IN THE LOBBY OF A BANK, AND HE CLAIMED THAT HE HAD VISITED ON BEHALF OF THE COLLECTIVE AS PART OF A PHISHING EXPEDITION ON A FREELANCE PENETRATION TEST OF THE BANK’S SECURITY. WHEN CHALLENGED ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF THIS HE CLAIMED IT WAS A WHITE HAT EXERCISE AND THAT NO WEAKNESSES HAD BEEN FOUND SO NO FURTHER ACTION HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THE COLLECTIVEUNDER FURTHER QUESTIONING HOWEVER IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE SUSPECT WAS TALKING ABOUT AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT BANK FROM THE SWISS BANK WE HAD BEEN MONITORING. HE SEEMED TO BELIEVE THAT WE HAD FOOTAGE OF HIM IN AN OSLO BRANCH. AGENTS WERE SENT TO RETRIEVE LOBBY FOOTAGE OF THIS BANK AND FURTHER ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT HIS VISITS THERE TALLIED WITH THE ACTIVITIES HE DESCRIBED AT INTERVIEW. HOWEVER, WE ALSO NOTICED THAT A WOMAN MATCHING DALMAR’S DESCRIPTION WAS OFTEN VIDEOED AT THE SAME BRANCH DURING THE PERIOD UNDER INVESTIGATIONWHEN ASKED ABOUT THIS THE SUSPECT BECAME HIGHLY AGITATED AND REPEATEDLY DEMANDED TO CALL HIS LAWYER. WE POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS UNUSUAL FOR A MEMBER OF A HACKING COLLECTIVE TO HAVE A LAWYER ON RETAINER, BUT THE SUSPECT REFUSED TO ANSWER ANY MORE QUESTIONS UNTIL HE HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO MAKE THE CALL. A CALL TRACE SHOWED THE MOBILE THAT HE RANG BELONGED TO A LAW FIRM WHICH WORKS FOR THE ARMS MANUFACTURER CITADELLE.THE SUSPECT WAS RELEASED ON BAIL PENDING CHARGES OF CONSPIRACY TO ENGAGE IN UNAUTHORISED ACCESS TO COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AT THE BANK AND IS BEING CLOSELY WATCHED. ALL CALLS TO AND FROM THE LAW FIRM ARE BEING MONITORED AND THE OSLO BANK IS UNDER TWENTY-FOUR/SEVEN SURVEILLANCE.CONCLUSIONS:WE BELIEVE WITH NEAR CERTAINTY THAT THE SUSPECT IS MARTIN TRAYNOR AND THAT THE WOMAN IN THE FOOTAGE IS JAMELIA DALMAR. WE BELIEVE THEY ARE IN COMMUNICATION WITH ONE ANOTHER AND ARE BOTH BEING PROTECTED BY CITADELLE OR ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE BOTH LIVING IN OR NEAR OSLO AND THAT THEY ARE BOTH NOW HIGHLY LIKELY TO BE AWARE THAT THE NET IS CLOSING IN. WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW DALMAR CONTRIVED TO FAKE HER DEATH AND WE STILL DO NOT HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE PDS SYNDICATE, DYNAMIX AND CITADELLE. NOR DO WE FULLY UNDERSTANDWHY THEY HAVE A STRONG INTEREST IN TRAYNOR AND DALMAR. WE BELIEVE THAT SOME OR ALL OF THAT INFORMATION MAY BE CONTAINED IN THE ENCRYPTED FILES ON TRAYNOR’S LAPTOP WHICH HAS BEEN PASSED TO FORENSICS FOR ANALYSIS AND TO SECURE THE DATA.WE HAVE MADE A DREADFUL MISTAKE AND I HAVE BEEN TOO SLOW TO ADMIT THAT TO MYSELF. I HAVE HAD A VISIT ROM THE WOMAN FROM THE SYNDICATE AND I CONFRONTED HER ABOUT THE SOURCE OF THE TEMPLATES. SHE CONFIRMED MY WORST FEARS AND NOW I WANT TO CRAWL AWAY AND DIE. WHAT HAVE WE DONE? OUR SOFTWARE HAS LED TO SO MUCH SUFFERING WHEN IT WAS DESIGNED TO DO THE OPPOSITE.I ASKED HER HOW THE CABINET OFFICE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE AUTHORISED THIS AND SHE LAUGHED ANDEXPLAINED THAT THE SYNDICATE NO LONGER WORKED FOR THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT. “CALL IT PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.” SHE SAID. “WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GOOD AT THAT”.MY HORROR MUST HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ALL OVER MY FACE. SHE DIDN’T SEEM SURPRISED AT MY REACTION, BUT EQUALLY SHE DIDN’T TAKE IT WELL AND CIVILITY WAS ABANDONED. I ASKED HER HOW IT COULD BE LEGAL, LET LONE MORAL, TO DO WHAT THEY PROPOSED, AND HER ANSWER WAS THAT IT WAS “NECESSARY”. I SAID WE WOULDN’T HELP THEM, AND SHE SAID IT WAS “NECESSARY” THAT WE DID. I SAID I WOULDN’T BE ABLE TO FACE MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS IF WE COOPERATED AND SHE SAID I WOULDN’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT FOR LONG, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THE PDS SYNDICATE WERE GOING TO MAKE SURE WTS PULL. BUT I THINK WE HAVE ONE LAST CHANCE.I AM SURE SHE WILL BE VISITING YOU AS WELL. SHE THINKS WE HAVE NO CHOICE, BUT I THINK A CHOICE IS ALL WE HAVE. WHATEVER YOU DO HOLD OUT FOR BETTER TERMS. SHE HAS TO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE ONSIDE AND MOTIVATED BY GREED SO THAT SHE WON’T WORRY ABOUT ANY QUALMS YOU MIGHT HAVE. CONVINCE HER THAT YOU WILL ONVINCE ME TO COOPERATE. TELL HER THAT YOU THINK YOU SHOULD WORK FROM THE COLLECTIVE IN OSLO AND THAT YOU WANT PAYMENT VIA THE BANK IN SWITZERLAND. I GOT THE IMPRESSION THATMONEY IS NOT A PROBLEM. WITH MONEY IN A SWISS BANK AND THE EXPERTISE AND CONNECTIVITY AFFORDED BY THE COLLECTIVE I THINK WE HAVE A CHANCE TO ESCAPE AND TO TRY TO STOP THEM. PERHAPS WE WILL SURVIVE THIS. PERHAPS WE CAN BRING THEM D
